# 🛸 K'uhul Multi Hive OS - Ollama-Powered Multi-Agent AI System

## 🌟 Overview

This PR introduces **K'uhul Multi Hive OS**, a sophisticated multi-agent orchestration system powered by Ollama with full ASX Language Framework integration.

## 🧠 KUHUL π: Pure AI Execution Language

KUHUL π is intentionally **not** an app language. It is a **pure AI execution language** with a closed, deterministic core:

* **No UI logic, orchestration, networking, or business rules**
* **No branching, loops, concurrency, or imperative “do X” semantics**

Those concerns live *outside* π.

### What π is for

1. **Geometric / symbolic tensors**
   * SVG-3D tensors, curvature fields, weight distributions, n-gram structures, latent geometry
   * In π: **tensors are fields**, operations are **collapse**, and shape changes are **lawful geometry**

2. **Compression as computation**
   * Axiom: **If it does not compress, it is not intelligence**
   * SCXQ2, symbolic compression, delta geometry, lane packing, weight collapse
   * Compression is **the interpreter**, not an optimization

3. **Data as curvature**
   * π does not “process data”
   * It perceives **field curvature**, extracts executable points, and collapses to a single lawful outcome
   * Ideal for inference substrates, distilled weights, and frozen model manifests

### What π explicitly forbids

| Thing | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Verbs | Introduce authority |
| Branching | Breaks collapse |
| Loops | Break determinism |
| Concurrency | Breaks single outcome |
| Control codes | Externalize execution |
| UI authority | Projection only |
| Runtime config | Breaks replay |
| “Do X” semantics | Not physics |

If you need `if`, `for`, `when`, `async`, `emit`, `handle`, or `subscribe`, it does **not** belong in π.

### Canonical stack

```
[ UI / App / Agents ]
        ↓
[ JS / Python / WASM ]
        ↓
[ XJSON / SCXQ2 ]
        ↓
[ KUHUL π ]   ← CLOSED, PURE
```

Only one layer is frozen forever: **π**. Everything else is a host, projection, or shadow.
